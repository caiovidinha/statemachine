# Traffic Light Simulator (State Machine)

## Overview

The Traffic Light Simulator is a simple Java application that simulates the behavior of a traffic light with three states: Red, Yellow, and Green. This project demonstrates the use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and graphical user interface (GUI) development using Java's Swing library.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The project is built using the Java programming language.

- **Swing:** Swing is used for creating the graphical user interface, allowing the visualization of the traffic light and its state transitions.

## Key Features

- **MVC Architecture:** The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for a clean separation of concerns.

- **Traffic Light States:** The traffic light cycles through the states of Red, Yellow, and Green with different durations for each state.

- **Graphical User Interface:** The application provides a visual representation of the traffic light, making it easy to observe state changes.

- **Modular Code:** The project is organized into separate classes for the model, view, and controller, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.

## Usage

1. Compile and run the `TrafficLightApp.java` file to start the Traffic Light Simulator.

2. The traffic light will cycle through its states (Red, Yellow, Green) with varying durations for each state.

3. Observe the graphical representation of the traffic light as it changes states.

## Getting Started

To run the Traffic Light Simulator on your local machine, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE), this is an Apache Netbeans project.
